# Hello, this is my project, which I am currently working on in my spare time.

The site is in progress.


This project is not a commercial site for a coffee shop. 
In this project, I implement the backend part in Python using the Django framework and the frontend part using ReactJS. 

At the moment, the site is not hosted because it does not have enough content (in my opinion).
Currently, only the main part is implemented on the site. I will attach its screenshots below.
